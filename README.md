# United States - Map of "inauguration" Twitter Tag 
Time was collected by January 20th, 2021 at around 11:00 am. The Tweepy API crawler took 5 minutes to collect.

**Result:** <br>
As on today is the Inauguration Day, I want to research how many Twitter tag of "inauguration" is being shown on the map. I decided to use the API crawler to collect the raw data just two hours after the inauguration began. The result isn't too shocking as I can see most people are participating, especially on the West and East coast. Not many tags in the middle of the U.S., perhaps it is either not many populations as on the West/East side or not many people want to see the inauguration. A cluster of tags around Washington D.C. isn't too surprising too.
